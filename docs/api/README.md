# API Documentation

These are docs autogenerated from the module itself.

# Building API Documentation

You must build the docs with a python interpreter that has sphinx and trame dependencies. We recommend using a virtual environment and the requirements.txt dependencies provided in this directory.
```
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r docs/api/requirements.txt
sphinx-build docs/api/source/ docs/api/dist/
```

# Adding new module
1. Copy this template into a new file in this directory, changeing `myCoolModule` to your module name.
```
trame.html.myCoolModule
======================
.. automodule:: trame.html.myCoolModule
   :members:
   :undoc-members:
   :show-inheritance:
```

2. (Optional) Hide parts of the module with `:exclude-members:`. You can see an example of this in `trame.html.vtk.rst`.

3. (Optional) Show imported members with `:imported-members:`. You can see an example of this in `trame.html.vtk.rst`.

4. Preview your docs by building and opening index.html
   
# Expected warnings:

We expose `vtk.common.*` through both html.paraview and html.vtk, which confuses the index for sphinx. We get many warnings looking like this.
```
WARNING: duplicate object description of trame.html.vtk.common.*, other instance in trame.html.paraview, use :noindex: for one of them
```
