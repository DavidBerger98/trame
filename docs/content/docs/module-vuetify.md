# Vuetify

Vuetify is a UI Library with beautifully handcrafted Material Components. No design skills required â€” everything you need to create amazing applications is at your fingertips.

## How to use it?

Trame wraps Vuetify as it's primary UI Component Library. The original [Vuetify's website](https://vuetifyjs.com/en/) is very well made for exploring components and understanding components parameters and controls.

The way trame translate Vue templates into plain Python code is by doing the following.

### Material Components

First you need to import the `vuetify` module so you can instantiate the various Material Components like illustrated below. Moreover, in the documentation the component names use `dashes` as separators while in Python we use the Camelcase notation for the class name.

```python
from trame.html import vuetify

# <v-btn>Hello World</v-btn>
btn = vuetify.VBtn("Hello World")
```

### Boolean attributes

Implicit attribute values must be explicit in Python by assigning `True` to them.

```python
# <v-text-field disabled />
vuetify.VTextField(disabled=True)
```

### Dash and colon separators

Any special caracters (`-` and `:`) become `_` in Python.

```python
# <v-text-field v-model="myText" />
vuetify.VTextField(v_model=("myText",))
```

### Events

Events in vue are prefixed with a `@` but in Python we declare them the same way we declare regular attributes.

```python
def runMethod():
    pass

# <v-btn @click="runMethod" />
vuetify.VBtn(click=runMethod)
```

## Examples

Vuetify is the core of any widgets structure we use inside our examples.

- [VTK/ContourGeometry](https://github.com/Kitware/trame/blob/master/examples/VTK/ContourGeometry/DynamicLocalRemoteRendering.py#L96-L132) has a Toggle buttons group, switch, slider and a button.
- [PlainPython/Markdown](https://github.com/Kitware/trame/blob/master/examples/PlainPython/Markdown/Simple.py#L27-L32) has a drop down to select which file to load.
- [GeoMaps/UberPickupsNYC](https://github.com/Kitware/trame/blob/master/examples/PlainPython/GeoMaps/UberPickupsNYC/app.py#L38-L44) use Row and Cols to manage content layout.

<!--
## Evaluating properties
Trame evaluates properties if they are wrapped in a tuple.
```python
from trame.html import vuetify

# This sets the label to "myLabel"
vuetify.VTextField(label="myLabel")

# This evaluates "myLabel" in Trame's Shared State for a value to set
vuetify.VTextField(label=("myLabel",))

# This evaluates "myLabel", which was initially set to "Initial Label"
vuetify.VTextField(label=("myLabel", "Initial Label"))
```
-->
