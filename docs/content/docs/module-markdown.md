# Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight markup language that you can use to add formatting elements to plaintext text documents. Created by John Gruber in 2004, Markdown is now one of the worldâ€™s most popular markup languages.

Inside Trame it might be usefull to use markdown to simplify the writing of long description and help when some formatting is expected.

## How to use it?

Trame supports an extended version of markdown for formatting documents, drawing diagrams, and more. Since Markdown could contains caracters that can conflict with the HTML syntax, a variable must be used to pass the markdown content to the UI component like in the snippet below.

```python
from trame.html import markdown

initial_value = """
# Some markdown...

Welcome to "Trame"!
"""

# UI Component
markdown.Markdown(
  v_model=("md_content", initial_value), # variable binding with initial value
)
```

Trame rely on markdown-it-vue (see documentation [here](http://www.aqcoder.com/markdown)) which support the following set of plugins:
- Official markdown syntax
- [AsciiMath](http://asciimath.org/)
- Images with size-control
- Simple charts with [Apache echarts](https://echarts.apache.org/examples/en/index.html)
- Diagrams like flow charts and Gantt charts with [Mermaid diagrams](https://mermaid.live)
- And more!
