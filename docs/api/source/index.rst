Welcome to Trame's documentation!
=================================

.. note::

   Trame v2 is replacing trame v1 by providing even more flexibility and deployment capabilities.
   Now trame officially support desktop, client/server, cloud and Jupyter as execution environment.
   But we also refined trame API to make it more robust and future proof.
   Some deep redesign will also allow integration of trame components into existing Web applications
   while also streamlining community contribution for new widgets.
